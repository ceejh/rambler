# rambler

A simple and language-independent SQL schema migration tool

## Installation

Go users can simply compile it from source and install it as a go executable using the following command :

```
go install github.com/elwinar/rambler
```

Others will have to wait for me to have time to cross-compile the executables and do a distribution websiteâ€¦ nothing really fancy (thank to golang), but not done yet.

## Usage

### Migrations

In rambler, migrations are kept in the simplest form possible: a migration is a list of sections (`up` and `down`), each section being *chunks* of sql. Example:

```sql
-- rambler up

CREATE TABLE foo (
	id INTEGER UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	bar VARCHAR(60),
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- rambler down

DROP TABLE foo;
```

Sections are delimited by SQL comments sufixed by the rambler marker (white-spaces sensitive). While applying a migration, rambler will execute each `up` section in order, and while reversing it it will execute each `down` section in reverse order.

Migrations filename must be of the form `version_comment.sql`, version being an integer value, and comment an underscored string. Examples:

* `201409272258_Added_table_foo.sql`
* `01_First_migration.sql`

### Configuration

Rambler configuration is lightweight: just dump the credentials of your database and the path to your migrations' directory into a JSON (or YAML or TOML) file, and you're done. Here is an example or JSON configuration file with the default values of rambler:

```json
{
	"driver": "mysql",
	"protocol": "tcp",
	"host": "localhost",
	"port": 3306,
	"user": "root",
	"password": "",
	"database": "",
	"migrations": "."
}
```

When running, rambler will try to find a configuration file in the working directory and use its values to connect to the managed database. Every option can be overriden at runtime by the matching command-line option (`rambler help` to get the shorthands).

### Applying a migration

To apply a migration, use the `apply` command.

```
rambler apply
```

Rambler will compare the migrations already applied and the available migrations in increasing version order to find the next migration to apply, then execute all its `up` sections' statements in order. 

### Reversing a migration

To reverse a migration, use the `reverse` command.

```
rambler reverse
```

Rambler will compare the migrations already applied and the available migrations in decreasing version order to find the last applied migrations, then execute all its `down` sections' statements in reverse order.

### Options

You can tell rambler to repeat the process while there is a migration to apply (or reverse) with the `all` flag (or its shorthand, `a`).

### Errors

To ensure database schema consistency, rambler will complain and stop when encountering a new migration in the middle of the already existing ones or if it can't find a migration already applied.

### Environments

An environment is an additionnal configuration that is given a name, and can be used to create multiple configurations for a single application (for example, to differenciate production, testing, etc).

Environments are defined in the configuration file, under the `environments` item. Each environment is defined as an attribute of this item, the key being the name and the value being the configuration options.

Environments configuration are derived from the default configuration of rambler (at the configuration file's root), so you only need to override the needed options:

```json
{
	"driver": "mysql",
	"protocol": "tcp",
	"port": 3306,
	"user": "root",
	"password": "",
	"database": "rambler_default",
	"migrations": "migrations",
	"environments": {
		"development": {
			"database": "rambler_development"
		},
		"testing": {
			"database": "rambler_testing"
		}
	}
}
```

Here we have three environments defined:
- `default`, will use the `rambler_default` database,
- `development`, will use the `rambler_development` database,
- `testing`, will use the `rambler_testing` database;

## TODO

* Add a `refresh` command that will reverse the last migration then apply it again
* Add a `number` option to choose the number of migrations to apply, reverse, or refresh
